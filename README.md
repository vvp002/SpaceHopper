University of California, San Diego

Made for AthenaHacks 2017

# Description
Space Hopper is the latest evolution of Flappy Bird, where a very terrible rocket must complete its journey across the galaxy one hop at a time. Its fate lies in the hands of a nameless, all-powerful entity that must guide it through the never ending attack of asteroids. 

# Impact
To entertain people in their time of need, whether it be from boredom, from pain, or from the monotony of life. It is meant to help people relax and have a good time. Our target: everyone. Our goal: survive. Our enemies: boredom .... and asteroids.
